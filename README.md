# Rust (Tonic gPRC Toolkit) gRPC Rocket Launcher Web Service
Rust (Google gRPC using Rust Tonic gRPC Toolkit) Web Service (Rocket Launch Web Service)

## Overview of the Service

This Rust client and server using Google gRPC uses the gPRC HTTP/2 protocol and the use of Google Protocol Buffers (protobufs) to avoid the slowness using REST/JSON request and response serialization suffered using REST APIs. This entry-level gRPC web service will show how to the client and servers exchange data using single non-streamed request/single-response, single non-streamed request/streamed response for the sending APIs and streamed-request/single non-streamed response, streamed-request/streamed response for the receiving APIs.
